L3afpad - GTK+ based simple text editor


Description
===========

L3afpad is a simple GTK+ text editor that emphasizes simplicity. As development
focuses on keeping weight down to a minimum, only the most essential features
are implemented in the editor. L3afpad is simple to use, is easily compiled,
requires few libraries, and starts up quickly.

L3afpad differs from its ancestor [leafpad](http://tarot.freeshell.org/leafpad/),
in that it uses GTK3 (while leafpad uses GTK2).

This program is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2,
see the file 'COPYING' for more information.
